// File Descriptor Duplication: Design a program that duplicates a file descriptor using the dup system call. For example, open a file, duplicate its descriptor, and use both descriptors to read and write simultaneously.

// Process Tree: Create a program that generates a hierarchical process tree using multiple fork calls. Each process should print its own PID and the PID of its parent process.

// Named Pipes (FIFOs): Explore the concept of named pipes (FIFOs) by creating two processesâ€”one to write data into a FIFO and another to read from it. Ensure synchronization and proper cleanup.
// Pipeline Processing: Build a task where multiple processes form a pipeline. Each process in the pipeline reads data from its input, processes it in some way, and passes it to the next process through pipes. For example, you can implement a simple text transformation pipeline.

// File Redirection: Develop a program that demonstrates file redirection. Allow the user to specify input and output files as command-line arguments and use dup or similar calls to redirect input and output accordingly.

// Process Synchronization: Explore process synchronization concepts using fork. For instance, create a scenario where multiple child processes synchronize their execution using a shared resource (e.g., a semaphore or mutex).

// Signal Handling: Design tasks that involve signal handling using fork. One process can send a signal to another process, and the receiver should handle the signal appropriately (e.g., catching and ignoring it).

// Parallel Processing: Create a program that utilizes fork to parallelize a task, such as searching for a specific string in a large file. Measure and compare the execution time with and without parallelization.
